This is my first complete page, entirely in HTML, with a small portion in CSS. 
This page represents my efforts in my studies and demonstrates my commitment to learning and improving more and more.

In this project, I developed a fairly simple page for a veterinary clinic, containing information about the clinic, opening hours, contact phone number, 
and an iframe with the clinic's location. Additionally, I included a basic fill-in form and navigation between pages.
